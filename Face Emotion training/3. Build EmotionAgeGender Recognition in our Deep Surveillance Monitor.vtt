00:00.690 --> 00:06.150
Hi and welcome to chapter eighteen point three where we're going to build a deep surveillance facial

00:06.150 --> 00:10.980
monitoring system that combines emotion age and gender recognition.

00:11.010 --> 00:15.910
So now let's go into an update on that book and our virtual machine and start building this.

00:16.200 --> 00:16.530
OK.

00:16.560 --> 00:18.170
So we're in chapter 18.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.380
No footnote but book for this.

00:20.640 --> 00:28.650
But is no 18.00 Reiffel notebook file whereas it is actually in here into to make it to quickly into

00:28.650 --> 00:31.110
the age gender estimation for the hill.

00:31.110 --> 00:31.460
All right.

00:31.470 --> 00:32.820
So click it.

00:32.940 --> 00:39.870
And what this is this is basically a guitar project I pulled it for one of the best one of the better

00:39.870 --> 00:42.740
ones I should say for age and gender detection.

00:43.020 --> 00:47.820
And the reason why I don't get it is for this code and what we're going to do we're going to use his

00:47.820 --> 00:52.500
Pretorian model is mainly because it's this data set and it's.

00:52.760 --> 00:53.750
It's not loaded here.

00:53.890 --> 00:58.320
I hope it always will be taken up way too much space probably isn't.

00:58.320 --> 01:03.390
But it's still said that he create He loaded he turned it on is quite large and I actually did have

01:03.390 --> 01:11.670
a project prior to this where we were treating it on that dataset for age and stuff stop it's OK for

01:11.670 --> 01:14.280
age and that's why.

01:14.620 --> 01:14.920
OK.

01:14.970 --> 01:18.240
In fact the dataset is here is not good at all.

01:18.240 --> 01:18.490
All right.

01:18.510 --> 01:21.380
So I'm going to leave that before I give it to you guys.

01:21.390 --> 01:23.070
All right back to this.

01:23.130 --> 01:23.690
OK.

01:24.030 --> 01:28.680
So either way when you're trying this model you actually can train his on his model here.

01:28.820 --> 01:29.170
All right.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.560
He has the code to train.

01:30.630 --> 01:35.180
However it is not quick and it is basically a standard training procedure.

01:35.190 --> 01:39.490
What we have done before but it is not worth the effort to do in a CPE use system.

01:39.510 --> 01:45.780
So I said you know what we will just actually just use our Pretorian models and we will just Pretorian

01:45.780 --> 01:52.860
model and it's a good exercise to basically executing someone else's model is actually it may seem like

01:52.860 --> 01:55.620
cheating sometimes but you can learn a lot.

01:55.620 --> 01:56.180
All right.

01:56.220 --> 01:58.120
So I'll quickly.

01:58.150 --> 01:59.970
This is his project here.

02:00.180 --> 02:01.270
Let's bring this up.

02:01.290 --> 02:02.780
All right.

02:03.250 --> 02:07.890
First what are we going to do is basically because he has some of the books he should actually label

02:08.100 --> 02:09.290
what our minds are.

02:09.540 --> 02:11.350
So student quickly.

02:11.400 --> 02:11.660
All right.

02:11.670 --> 02:18.030
So this is going to be eighteen point tree it's called us.

02:18.770 --> 02:20.660
And second one we're going to run right after.

02:20.690 --> 02:26.360
So we combine them both because firstly what we're going to run is his age and gender detector and Despard

02:26.400 --> 02:28.600
be eighteen point tree.

02:28.710 --> 02:30.700
B look at.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.080
So now let's bring this up.

02:32.180 --> 02:33.420
Stick a look at this.

02:35.020 --> 02:35.370
Right.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.960
So this is what I think I wanted.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.440
This was his get help for his project.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.240
OK.

02:40.690 --> 02:43.020
Now I believe this was him.

02:43.060 --> 02:47.860
If I'm not mistaken there was a slight issue with his project that didn't run off the bat and I had

02:47.860 --> 02:49.400
to make some changes in the file.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.540
Luckily I did make the changes in the file.

02:51.540 --> 02:56.620
So if you you don't have to put this code from scratch his code is already in this field that we saw

02:56.620 --> 02:57.680
here.

02:57.700 --> 03:03.070
So basically he what's good about this still is that he does give some instructions some if you wanted

03:03.070 --> 03:08.690
to actually train the model on you and he can trance on different data sets as well.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.460
This is that is that he included in his file.

03:11.860 --> 03:17.000
You can train Athill or you can use some of his demo file is the file we are actually going to.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.040
That's the way it's open.

03:19.060 --> 03:21.690
And you can see it here.

03:21.810 --> 03:27.160
We don't want to doing it because I already have downloaded it and basically have been trapped under

03:27.200 --> 03:28.980
I MVB basically this.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.910
I am D-B data here talks about here.

03:31.910 --> 03:37.520
Basically someone's script I am divvies Web site you know Internet Movie Database website extracted

03:37.520 --> 03:43.520
defaces and actually labeled the ages and gender which might have been a quite tedious task but they

03:43.520 --> 03:44.150
did it.

03:44.180 --> 03:44.730
OK.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.350
So these are his results here.

03:47.420 --> 03:52.730
His Pretorian model is lost is quite low for age and gender.

03:52.730 --> 03:53.860
Not that low in the end.

03:53.870 --> 03:55.490
But it's fine.

03:55.670 --> 04:03.700
And so he probably stopped at some pre-trained really something and got the Marlow's out before accuracy

04:04.100 --> 04:05.720
and the stuff went to hell.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.370
Actually I'm looking at around accuracy.

04:07.490 --> 04:10.600
This is a one blue green and blue.

04:10.690 --> 04:13.040
Like I said fine either way.

04:13.090 --> 04:15.080
Definitely we're sitting here

04:18.070 --> 04:22.800
actually is not fitting that is actually on his training data set.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.250
So this kind of results to be fair.

04:25.260 --> 04:25.890
All right.

04:26.110 --> 04:28.110
Either way it worked fine.

04:28.120 --> 04:34.690
And as an exercise for you guys if you're very if you're interested in seeing how this works his code

04:34.690 --> 04:35.510
is here.

04:35.630 --> 04:37.360
It's fairly well documented as well.

04:37.390 --> 04:42.460
So you can take a look and try doing some cool stuff with this what we're doing now is using his preaching

04:42.460 --> 04:42.860
model.

04:42.890 --> 04:51.010
So basically extracted the code from his project code is code and doing it here and I it in the book.

04:51.010 --> 04:56.110
So let's step through this code quickly it's not that different than the previous code just some little

04:56.110 --> 04:57.810
things you should note.

04:57.880 --> 05:04.220
Firstly this is how we load his model and we have to specify a hash when we look at his model.

05:04.360 --> 05:08.530
So go back to our face detector results.

05:08.530 --> 05:09.950
This is what gives us our faces.

05:09.970 --> 05:14.220
And this is what displays our results actually.

05:14.470 --> 05:15.340
Let me just check something.

05:15.340 --> 05:17.610
I don't believe I'm using that function any more.

05:17.980 --> 05:20.420
And I am right I am not using it anymore.

05:20.430 --> 05:23.700
So that's to it on.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.050
Totally unnecessary.

05:25.050 --> 05:26.400
All right.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.020
So now these are the moral premises here.

05:29.220 --> 05:29.900
OK.

05:30.270 --> 05:31.360
Just say no.

05:31.380 --> 05:34.040
Can I leave this alone ok dept OK.

05:34.100 --> 05:39.230
With none is all the specific specifications for loading his model.

05:39.270 --> 05:39.820
OK.

05:39.990 --> 05:41.180
His pre-trained weights.

05:41.190 --> 05:46.850
So we do that so we have his model we loaded it we got the weights and everything from his model and

05:46.870 --> 05:50.770
each the EF 5 format.

05:51.080 --> 05:54.450
So no set up stuff.

05:54.630 --> 05:55.820
We get his model.

05:55.920 --> 06:00.250
Fitbit does or does not go with his model here and model that load.

06:00.270 --> 06:02.600
So we get his model now officially.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.420
All right.

06:03.810 --> 06:06.500
So we initialize a webcam here.

06:06.510 --> 06:10.940
Standard stuff we said is if you've seen before we get this.

06:11.070 --> 06:15.840
Now what I've done I've made some changes to this code because the previous code didn't tell you.

06:15.900 --> 06:21.780
But if a second person appeared in the diagram it would only show one if you guys are the time it doesn't

06:21.780 --> 06:23.210
show more than one face.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.380
Oh it may have him trash.

06:25.410 --> 06:27.380
I'm not even sure you can do it.

06:27.390 --> 06:28.360
Bring a friend.

06:28.730 --> 06:29.040
OK.

06:29.130 --> 06:31.250
I have no friends with me right right now the wife is out.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.370
So I can't test that.

06:32.640 --> 06:33.970
But that's OK.

06:33.990 --> 06:37.910
So this is how actually got it to work with multiple faces.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.340
So we do this here.

06:41.130 --> 06:47.430
Basically we append the faces we extract here and then what we do we use his model that we loaded here

06:48.050 --> 06:51.200
to make a prediction and this prediction gives us two things.

06:51.220 --> 06:54.450
Gender first very male female.

06:54.540 --> 06:59.640
I know there are many agendas right now but for now is history in the male and female because the genders

07:00.070 --> 07:03.270
will still look like male or female either way.

07:03.270 --> 07:04.070
So that's fine.

07:04.340 --> 07:04.930
All right.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.600
And so we have predicted ages here as well.

07:08.890 --> 07:12.580
And this is all in a bit of a funny shape here.

07:12.820 --> 07:14.380
So he does some reshipping.

07:14.400 --> 07:14.730
All right.

07:14.770 --> 07:15.640
And flattens it.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.380
And then we get the results here.

07:17.380 --> 07:20.430
So we get the predicted ages and this is good.

07:20.520 --> 07:20.900
All right.

07:20.920 --> 07:21.470
So we get it.

07:21.470 --> 07:28.270
No no what we're going to do since we have multiple we possibly have multiple cases in this file is

07:28.270 --> 07:34.850
that we go through defaces and go through the results and display the results later on here.

07:35.380 --> 07:36.170
OK.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.250
And that is it.

07:38.260 --> 07:40.110
This is what runs forward.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.290
Age and gender.

07:41.620 --> 07:42.930
So let's give it a try.

07:47.660 --> 07:51.400
Slutting probably a learning model.

07:51.410 --> 07:52.280
There we go.

07:52.310 --> 07:53.950
So that is pretty awesome.

07:54.260 --> 08:00.950
All right what I'm going to do going to bring up a picture of my funny face and try to simulate this

08:01.010 --> 08:05.960
with another person or a pretend person we're going to use

08:10.180 --> 08:12.540
I guess is actually hard and I taught

08:17.740 --> 08:18.030
it.

08:18.120 --> 08:24.160
So my friend here she has some good face pictures.

08:24.270 --> 08:27.200
I hope she's OK with me using this right.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.700
OK so I'm going to bring this up here.

08:36.270 --> 08:36.560
OK.

08:36.600 --> 08:41.530
So this is me this is my friend is not detecting.

08:41.550 --> 08:42.200
Oh there we go.

08:43.220 --> 08:44.630
Thinks she's a guy.

08:44.680 --> 08:45.790
I have no idea.

08:45.820 --> 08:47.470
She doesn't need any of this.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.210
And so I think she's a guy.

08:49.350 --> 08:52.360
Now there's a problem here and I hope you can see it.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.630
And I did actually see it in the code and didn't mention it to you guys because I was like wondering

08:56.260 --> 08:59.690
how it doesn't work the way it does supposed to doesn't it.

08:59.920 --> 09:06.790
And that's because exactly as I said it will detect the faces here but it only draws results for one

09:06.790 --> 09:09.760
prediction here because it's not a pending results results.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.700
In theory this is something I fix later on.

09:12.700 --> 09:15.240
By the way so for now though just be aware.

09:15.250 --> 09:21.800
At this age and gender detector only technically detects one face at a time not two.

09:22.240 --> 09:26.020
And basically this is something I also noted here.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.850
If you get this early.

09:27.970 --> 09:30.900
This is the area you'll see here faces not being detected.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.430
It's because your webcam has not been turned on.

09:33.430 --> 09:41.260
So basically if this happened this happens just go to devices and webcams and tick tick tick off.

09:41.320 --> 09:41.890
OK.

09:42.520 --> 09:43.250
So that is that.

09:43.270 --> 09:48.790
And if whatever reason this program crashes when you're messing with the code and the webcam isn't released

09:49.060 --> 09:55.120
that will happen quite often I'm sure just run this line separately to reclaim your webcam so that you

09:55.120 --> 09:58.220
can re-initialize it again later on.

09:58.240 --> 09:58.570
OK.

09:58.660 --> 10:03.410
So no that was age and gender and a Eating point tree.

10:03.640 --> 10:04.330
Now let's do.

10:04.330 --> 10:06.630
Age and gender with emotions.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.430
That's the cool part.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.800
That's deep surveillance partner.

10:10.810 --> 10:18.100
So again let's load all of this 10 seconds wasted of my life again.

10:19.810 --> 10:24.610
Yoga seemed faster this time maybe me complain.

10:25.130 --> 10:25.460
OK.

10:25.550 --> 10:30.290
So no this is testing emotion agent and using a webcam.

10:30.430 --> 10:37.350
Now I'm not going to go through this code in super detail because it is a bit messy.

10:37.880 --> 10:43.640
However what I'm going to tell you is that I have manipulated this code to support two faces.

10:43.640 --> 10:44.590
All right.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.800
So let's give this ago.

10:47.270 --> 10:49.880
Bring up my friend's Instagram picture again

10:54.990 --> 10:55.330
OK.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.490
So we got an error.

10:57.610 --> 10:59.050
Color is not defined.

10:59.210 --> 11:02.290
Like I'm going to pause this and see what is happening here.

11:02.770 --> 11:04.430
I know exactly what's happening.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.040
I was trying to do some color manipulation before.

11:07.260 --> 11:07.540
OK.

11:07.610 --> 11:12.140
CBG are Spudis get back green OK.

11:12.240 --> 11:13.430
It is going to.

11:13.700 --> 11:18.780
Oh dammit what happened is that it claimed my webcam.

11:18.940 --> 11:21.900
It's not going to get an image.

11:21.910 --> 11:27.850
So what we can do as I mentioned before and I did not put it in this file accessible area just put a

11:27.850 --> 11:34.690
cell below and reclean my webcam so I can run this finally again

11:37.860 --> 11:38.720
I attempted it.

11:38.750 --> 11:39.300
There we go.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.150
So yeah I'm not actually sad.

11:42.260 --> 11:44.710
I don't know why it's tinks I'm sad no neutral.

11:45.060 --> 11:50.230
And bring up the multiple face Gladys's Merde is confusing.

11:52.290 --> 11:55.380
At still in.

11:55.400 --> 11:58.780
Why I doing a in front of me.

12:00.900 --> 12:01.850
All right.

12:01.910 --> 12:03.040
Come on detect

12:12.320 --> 12:13.630
get a brief second.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.680
But let me just bring this.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.800
This is much easier when you actually have a real person next to you.

12:21.690 --> 12:22.220
OK.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.430
I'm going to pause this and get a better picture.

12:24.430 --> 12:25.270
No offense.

12:25.430 --> 12:27.920
This picture has not been affected.

12:28.480 --> 12:28.850
OK.

12:28.990 --> 12:37.920
So hold one second because the recording that really put it on as fast forward this bit while I just

12:37.920 --> 12:44.240
waste time like.

12:44.410 --> 12:44.700
All right.

12:44.710 --> 12:52.290
So I found a picture of my wife I may use from a Facebook profile maybe I should use like stock images.

12:52.290 --> 12:55.610
It seems like these images don't have the best luck but we'll never know.

12:55.610 --> 12:55.820
All right.

12:55.820 --> 12:59.060
So let's put it in front here.

12:59.240 --> 13:08.560
I just saw a detective come back from back in says I actually thought it looks because now I can see

13:08.560 --> 13:09.320
my screen.

13:10.210 --> 13:14.590
And I can see my face and it's not detecting my face.

13:14.590 --> 13:16.370
Maybe I should just bring this back slightly.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.320
There we go.

13:17.830 --> 13:18.230
OK.

13:18.370 --> 13:24.670
So I know my wife is going to be happy with this but I think she's a guy who is 24 years old.

13:24.940 --> 13:31.160
Probably because it's from a cell phone and the skill is definitely going to be off because of it.

13:31.450 --> 13:33.930
I'm 28 when I'm 24.

13:34.330 --> 13:35.400
Damn you.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.230
Sorry to deduct it.

13:37.570 --> 13:37.830
OK.

13:37.870 --> 13:40.620
When it starts kind of to kind of going to hold.

13:40.660 --> 13:45.940
All right so what this means here is that this code works.

13:45.940 --> 13:52.420
It's not exactly 100 percent accurate with gender detection as we can see but that probably has to do

13:52.420 --> 13:53.590
with my little fake friends.

13:53.590 --> 13:55.210
I'm using my cell phone.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.010
These people are REAL by the way.

13:57.380 --> 14:02.790
But either way this should not happen that way but it works it works.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.810
It's good that is directing multiple pictures multiple people.

14:06.820 --> 14:07.120
All right.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.500
So this is good.

14:09.550 --> 14:13.680
Let's move on to the next one images so let's run this

14:19.570 --> 14:23.060
OK so now let's run this test on images.

14:23.070 --> 14:23.560
OK.

14:23.560 --> 14:27.300
You did not load anything in my bed

14:30.260 --> 14:31.460
not that or

14:38.140 --> 14:38.620
OK.

14:38.630 --> 14:44.480
So let's test this on some test images and you can place those images in the images folder.

14:44.930 --> 14:45.550
Will show you here.

14:45.590 --> 14:45.910
OK.

14:45.980 --> 14:49.840
So let's look at Donald Trump oh this is quite funny.

14:49.950 --> 14:57.440
I think it's a female 59 looks much older in my opinion but fifty nine and said It's me again.

14:57.460 --> 15:01.050
I did some extra years to me because I'm actually actually 24.

15:01.140 --> 15:02.310
But fair enough.

15:03.940 --> 15:04.330
All right.

15:04.330 --> 15:06.560
Queen Elizabeth and something funny is happening.

15:06.640 --> 15:10.930
It actually thinks this bouquet of roses is a guy who took the ideas off.

15:11.170 --> 15:16.360
Clearly this is a bad example of Mitt not working too well.

15:16.840 --> 15:17.710
But there's a reason for that.

15:17.720 --> 15:18.870
I'll tell you afterwards.

15:18.910 --> 15:19.800
OK.

15:20.470 --> 15:21.270
Barack Obama.

15:21.460 --> 15:24.260
Male angry to the one not the best.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.480
Is my wife.

15:25.480 --> 15:30.870
Female tity she actually was tastiness Richardsons quite good and she was definitely happy here.

15:31.100 --> 15:31.590
All right.

15:31.660 --> 15:35.350
She was actually this was the two days of the pictures were two days apart.

15:35.380 --> 15:37.860
So she aged a year in those two days.

15:38.260 --> 15:38.560
OK.

15:38.590 --> 15:40.040
So that's cool.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.750
Now I said I'll tell you why.

15:42.010 --> 15:49.350
That's because when we were doing this here we were basically Horncastle pacifies don't crop enough

15:49.350 --> 15:55.090
of the face out even with the default settings here which are removed because you may have seen it in

15:55.100 --> 16:01.710
a court because it just cut and paste some of these images discotheques or videos before we actually

16:01.710 --> 16:04.070
had some cropping being done.

16:04.140 --> 16:07.080
And I took it out because it was less accurate.

16:07.410 --> 16:10.350
But now anyway so you libs facial recognition.

16:10.350 --> 16:12.380
Let's give this a try.

16:12.390 --> 16:13.470
Let's quickly run this

16:17.750 --> 16:19.830
and I'll tell you about dealing with starting in the back row here.

16:19.850 --> 16:21.180
I'll tell you about dealer dealer.

16:21.220 --> 16:27.460
It is it's a machine learning basically package that was built in C++ and you can use it into Python

16:27.800 --> 16:29.210
and it does a bunch of cool stuff.

16:29.210 --> 16:34.430
And what I'm using it here for is for phase detection but it actually can do facial recognition.

16:34.460 --> 16:39.480
In my open C-v course in the past I haven't included in discourse.

16:39.590 --> 16:47.170
You actually do use Nonpoint recognition on faces for some cool projects like your detection and the

16:47.540 --> 16:50.400
swaps as well more advanced with swaps.

16:50.390 --> 16:50.680
All right.

16:50.740 --> 16:53.660
So I'm sorry I'm retarded.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.690
We are using the live on images here.

16:55.700 --> 17:00.110
I really should label this that I think in the last section used to live on the webcam.

17:00.140 --> 17:01.120
Yes.

17:01.250 --> 17:01.970
OK.

17:02.120 --> 17:02.980
So again.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.280
So it actually is.

17:04.340 --> 17:08.820
Now a trump he actually aged two years less fend off me.

17:08.980 --> 17:09.420
Oh.

17:09.430 --> 17:10.790
You know when you're younger.

17:10.790 --> 17:11.900
That's good.

17:12.830 --> 17:14.130
Fifty four female OK.

17:14.200 --> 17:14.980
Fair enough.

17:14.980 --> 17:16.420
She has a lot.

17:16.610 --> 17:18.030
In that picture.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.200
That's fine.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.500
Tony correct.

17:21.970 --> 17:27.220
Barack Obama 45 I think he was in his late 40s and this picture may be very very accurate actually is

17:27.220 --> 17:28.760
quite close.

17:29.180 --> 17:35.590
And my wife she would not be happy with each year but it's fair enough again because she was Tuti in

17:35.590 --> 17:36.670
those pictures.

17:37.000 --> 17:37.950
OK but fair enough.

17:37.950 --> 17:39.860
So you can experiment with some different things.

17:39.860 --> 17:41.500
You know it's not going to be perfect.

17:41.500 --> 17:45.440
Age is actually a very hard thing to guess.

17:45.460 --> 17:52.870
I myself sometimes have thought someone was to be in it today 25 or 26 and I learned later they were

17:52.870 --> 17:59.130
like 50 which was embarrassing but they were very happy about my mis take.

17:59.140 --> 18:04.170
So anyway we can run this with the lab using the webcam so I'm going on this.

18:04.300 --> 18:09.660
And I've changed my T-shirt by the way back to the one with stain unfortunately.

18:09.910 --> 18:12.340
Hope it isn't picked up in this camera.

18:12.340 --> 18:14.070
No it does not.

18:14.380 --> 18:15.620
And the bedroom doesn't open.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.660
Yeah it's fine.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.280
So again this is quite cool.

18:18.280 --> 18:22.570
You can definitely see dealer has a slew of film right here OK.

18:22.940 --> 18:27.290
And literally did my hair thing five seconds 10 seconds before.

18:27.610 --> 18:27.970
OK.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.820
So close.

18:30.340 --> 18:35.020
So the advantage of the lid though is that it is better at picking up faces.

18:35.050 --> 18:40.600
One thing you should have noted noted here is that it didn't mystic Queen Elizabeth's bouquet for a

18:40.600 --> 18:43.610
face like what a hawk husky classified did.

18:43.870 --> 18:47.170
So you can generally see that as better and more robust.

18:47.180 --> 18:53.650
Remember for Cutie Caskie classifies it or this was a face that it was a guy which I would think it

18:53.640 --> 18:54.240
was a female.

18:54.310 --> 18:57.660
Either way if it was a face that is.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.340
But that's fine.

19:00.340 --> 19:04.650
So what I'm saying Bakassi cast philosophise a definitely faster.

19:04.920 --> 19:09.850
So if speed is your concern or if your hardware if it's an embedded system you can use Hawkhurst justifies

19:10.300 --> 19:16.920
and maybe tweak some of the parameters like this scaling parameters especially this definitely helps.

19:16.960 --> 19:23.770
But these settings are generally well understood as the gold standard Woodhall Cascades like this is

19:23.780 --> 19:27.330
the best depending on your application.

19:27.350 --> 19:29.020
But generally this is the best.

19:29.500 --> 19:35.590
So a dealer may be more suited for some applications if its accuracy especially is of importance.

19:35.590 --> 19:37.540
OK so that's it for this chapter.

19:37.540 --> 19:42.160
I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you build something cool out of this and I hope you expand upon it

19:42.160 --> 19:42.490
too.

19:42.510 --> 19:47.980
You can actually take this code now and train and train over these models or add in some new stuff as

19:47.980 --> 19:48.370
well.

19:48.490 --> 19:50.010
And ethnicity as well.

19:50.020 --> 19:57.380
You can actually now take some of this data sets here like this one for one and maybe you can if you

19:57.380 --> 20:02.410
can find like a label that you can manually label the agenda from this as well to get even more accurate

20:02.470 --> 20:04.060
gender recognition.

20:04.060 --> 20:05.310
So this is pretty cool.

20:05.350 --> 20:12.850
And the challenge and in bringing both of these together which I probably failed to mention is that

20:13.530 --> 20:16.260
they're both taking different sized faces to boot.

20:16.270 --> 20:18.940
One is ticking and ticking in a color image.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.790
That's the age and gender sticking.

20:20.820 --> 20:26.730
Taking in a color image that's 64 by 64 whereas the other one which is all in motion detectors ticking

20:26.800 --> 20:30.410
in a smaller and gray scale image.

20:30.460 --> 20:34.780
So you have to sort of do some a little more processing here in our pipeline.

20:35.020 --> 20:41.180
And basically then you have to get the results and make sure they're lined up like the same face is

20:41.200 --> 20:47.590
tied together with his agent and the emotion which is fairly easy anyway and then plus and take it correctly

20:47.590 --> 20:51.480
and then making sure the labels follow the face around the image.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.390
So it was a fun piece of code to build.

20:54.400 --> 20:55.270
To be fair.

20:55.470 --> 20:55.760
But.
